# 🔥 Smart Calories Burnt Predictor

An interactive Machine Learning powered web application that predicts the estimated calories burned based on user fitness and body metrics.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Calories Burnt Predictor** is a Streamlit-based web application designed to provide real-time calorie burn predictions using a trained Machine Learning model.

Users can enter personal and exercise-related information such as age, height, weight, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature. The system processes these inputs and predicts the calories burned using a regression model trained on a real-world dataset.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, prediction serving, and deployment.
